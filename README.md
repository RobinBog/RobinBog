👋🏼 Hi, I’m @RobinBog
👀 I’m the data-loving nature boy 🌱
💞️ I am looking for cooperation in projects that are committed to nature and the environment.

I'm very curious, and data science helps me understand things better.
But keeping the results to myself is boring after all. Therefore, I use my design skills and create diagrams and presentations that quickly provide clarity and inform others.
At the beginning of my Data Science career, it was really not easy for me to create effective diagrams directly in Python. But eventually, I've created a process that allows me to significantly reduce the time between analysis and shared insights.

### Small example of how the same data can differ in presentation.
