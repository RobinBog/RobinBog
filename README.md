## Data Scientist with a passion for visualization

I'm very curious, and data science helps me understand things better.
<br />
At the beginning of my Data Science career, it was really not easy for me to create effective diagrams directly in Python. That's a skill you don't learn in a computer science degree.
<br />
<b>But keeping the results to myself is boring after all.</b> Therefore, I created a process that allowed me to significantly reduce the time between analyses and shared insights.
